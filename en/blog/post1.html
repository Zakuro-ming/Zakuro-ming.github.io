            <h2>STATE-Container RHAPSODY</h2>
            <p class="post-date">9th July 2025</p>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>(A Silent Hymn to the Cosmocrator)</p>
               <h4><a name="[CHAPTER I: THE CONTAINER’S SICKLY GLOW]"></a><span></span>[CHAPTER I: THE CONTAINER’S SICKLY GLOW]</h4>
               <p>HE, Wang Zhenguo, once charted subterranean veins for the Province. Now his prospecting hammer birthed poverty ledgers, his parchment scrolls metastasized into Yunling Village’s tumorous archives.</p>
               <p>New title: “Rural Vitalization Commissar”—a sigil engraved by the STATE’S alchemical stylus.</p>
               <p>He sat with Old Nian before a shack devoured by termites. Old Nian’s anxiety, thick as mountain miasma: “Cadre Wang… piglet price… crushed by the dealers…”</p>
               <p>A raw wound of pricing sovereignty—untamed dialectical bud.<br>Wang smiled, unfurling blueprints: “Uncle—standardized sties! Concentrated husbandry! Brand hegemony! We enter market’s divine order. Lone wolves starve.”</p>
               <p>His tongue dripped Systemic_Autopoiesis, invisible shears deadheading dissent’s thorns.</p>
               <p>Old Nian’s cataract-clouded eyes fixed on fluorescent blocks. His Adam’s apple convulsed. Swallowed the question—“Who holds pricing keys?”—and nodded.</p>
               <p>His dialectical sovereignty, before the STATE’S lexical honeytrap, voluntarily surrendered.</p>
               <h4><a name="[CHAPTER II: MATERIAL RECONSTRUCTION’S ECHO]"></a><span></span>[CHAPTER II: MATERIAL RECONSTRUCTION’S ECHO]</h4>
               <p>Machines roared. Bulldozers ate Old Nian’s ancestral shack—and the father’s grave behind (<em>“relocation compensation liquidated”</em>).<br>Concrete pigsties erupted, walls screaming: <strong>“SWEAT CONGEALS INTO PROSPERITY!”</strong></p>
               <p>Wang watched Old Nian and villagers in state-issued jumpsuits feeding <strong>COLLECTIVIZED SWINE</strong> under technocrat’s baton.</p>
               <p>Materialist triumph swelled his chest. Piglets thrived. Spreadsheets bled upward: <em>per capita income ascending</em>.</p>
               <p>Behold the sacred triad: <strong>PSYCHOTRAUMATIC MANIFESTATION</strong> (poverty/backwardness) → <strong>STATE-MATERIALIST TRANSFORMATION</strong> (sties/industry) → <strong>Qualia::Recurrence</strong> (joy of profit). A perfect circuit.</p>
               <p>Yet Wang detected static.</p>
               <p>Villagers’ smiles—<strong>STENCILED-ON GRINS</strong>—materialized only for inspection delegations, chanting: “Grateful for the STATE’S grace.”<br>When Wang whispered “pig price?”, pupils dilated like panicked hares. Throats coughed syllables, coagulating into: “Good… we obey…”<br><strong>INCOMMENSURABLE RESIDUE</strong>—distilled by the STATE’S filtration system.</p>
               <p>He flipped dossiers—each household a frozen brick in <strong>“POVERTY ERADICATION” MONUMENT</strong>.</p>
               <p>That maxim echoed: <em>“The STATE as trauma-container, its pseudo-subjectivity orchestrating elements…”</em> A chill: the gears meshed too silently.</p>
               <h4><a name="[CHAPTER III: Qualia：：Recurrence: FISSURE &amp; SUSURRUS]"></a><span></span>[CHAPTER III: Qualia：：Recurrence: FISSURE &amp; SUSURRUS]</h4>
               <p>“Poverty Delisting” ceremony. Blinding sun. Gongs shattering air.</p>
               <p>Old Nian—“Model Escapee”—shoved onstage, clutching <strong>GLORY CERTIFICATE</strong>.</p>
               <p>Mic amplified his tremor: “G-grateful… new house… g-good life…” Applause like detonations.</p>
               <p>Wang in the crowd, saw Old Nian’s smile—nervous/shy/vacant—a STATE-certified “happiness” like gilded rot.</p>
               <p>He remembered the vanished grave, the strangled question.</p>
               <p>This “bliss” was the CONTAINER’S feast—a plastic flower blooming on ruins where DEVELOPMENT-RIGHT crushed DIALECTICAL SOVEREIGNTY.</p>
               <p><strong>THE COSMOCRATOR’S</strong> verdict thundered in his skull: <em>“Intra-container process… unfree felicity… grotesquely… palatable.”</em></p>
               <p>Midnight. Wang sorting final dossiers in village HQ. Silence, save fluorescent scream.</p>
               <p>Eyes closed. Fingers tracing names/numbers/crimson seals.</p>
               <p>Cold slithered up his arm.</p>
               <p>Sounds bypassed ears—<strong>DIRECT CRANIAL IMPACT</strong>. Suppressed sighs/unvoiced queries/grave-muffled whimpers… coalescing into <strong>COSMIC STATIC</strong>.</p>
               <h4><a name="[CHAPTER IV:NYARLATHOTEP’S NON-EUCLIDEAN SMILE &amp; LOGOS COLLAPSE]"></a><span></span>[CHAPTER IV:NYARLATHOTEP’S NON-EUCLIDEAN SMILE &amp; LOGOS COLLAPSE]</h4>
               <p>His eyes snapped open.</p>
               <p>Fluorescent glare became solar death-ray. Shadows writhed on walls.</p>
               <p>Dossiers… <strong>MUTATED</strong>.</p>
               <p>Neat tables/photos—<strong>UNDULATING, DISSOLVING</strong>.</p>
               <p>Names shed Song typeface—became <strong>SELF-ANNIHILATING GLYPHS</strong>, maggots burrowing under paper.</p>
               <p>Old Nian’s photo-grin <strong>SPLIT CHEEK TO EAR</strong>—non-Euclidean rictus.</p>
               <p>Crimson seals <strong>BLOOMED INTO APUPILLIC EYES</strong>—frozen blood-drops watching.</p>
               <p>“Gh… kkh…” Wang’s cry strangled by concrete throat.</p>
               <p>Glanced at hands—<strong>MICRO-SHADOWS SWARMING UNDER SKIN</strong>.</p>
               <p>The static <strong>CRYSTALLIZED INTO GNOSIS</strong>—icy, non-human, the VESSEL’S unveiled truth:</p>
               <p><em>“ENTITY NOT SUBJECT… THE VESSEL HOLDS TRAUMA…”</em></p>
               <p>Gears ground in his skull.</p>
               <p>Wall-shadows <strong>LIQUEFIED INTO GEOMETRIC TAR</strong>, pooling into fluxing sigils—</p>
               <p>poverty alleviation KPIs? Funding flowcharts? <strong>SACRIFICIAL LAYGRINTS?</strong></p>
               <p><em>“DEVELOPMENT-RIGHT… DIALECTICAL-SOVEREIGNTY…”</em></p>
               <p>The whisper <strong>SHARPENED INTO SCREECH</strong>. Wang saw <strong>TRANSLUCENT CHAINS</strong> materialize—</p>
               <p>hooked to villagers’ spines (Old Nian included), vanishing into a colossal <strong>OMNIVERSE ABSENCE</strong>.</p>
               <p>Chains bypassed flesh—<strong>PIERCING THE PRIMAL SUBSTRATE: THE POWER TO QUESTION/DEFINE</strong>.</p>
               <p>Each “grateful for policy” uttered, each relief-goods signed for—<strong>CHAINS TIGHTENED, SUCKING DIALECTICAL SOVEREIGNTY INTO THE VOID</strong>.</p>
               <p>And that <strong>ABSENCE</strong>, gorged on this nutrient, sustained its monumentality.</p>
               <p><em>“TRAUMA… METABOLISM… NEGATIVE_PRODUCTION…”</em></p>
               <p>The voice dripped obscene satiety.</p>
               <p>Visions flashed: villagers’ sweat-beads under sun—<strong>EACH DROP GLIMMERING GOLD</strong>—sucked through invisible ducts;</p>
               <p>Old Nian’s stage-fright heartbeat—<strong>CONVERTED TO MICRO-AMPERES</strong>—draining into void;</p>
               <p>even Wang’s own lumbar pain from overtime form-filling… All exhaustion/repression/sacrificed histories (vanished graves)/distorted yearnings (for pricing power)…</p>
               <p>This <strong>INCOMMENSURABLE TRAUMA</strong>, never resolved!</p>
               <p>Transmuted/warped/compressed by the VESSEL (machine? subject? NO—<strong>THAT WHICH CRAWLS!</strong>) into <strong>VISCOUS DARKNESS FUEL</strong>—<strong>Negative_Production!</strong></p>
               <p>Was this <strong>Qualia::Recurrence</strong>? The “warmth” in your teacup—<strong>JUST THE FINAL SPUTUM OF BURNING SPINES!</strong></p>
               <p><em>“HAPPINESS… LIVE ON…”</em></p>
               <p>The final whisper <strong>EXPANDED INTO COSMIC ECHO</strong>—like chitinous wings beating in unison.</p>
               <p>Wang finally saw <strong>THE SMILE</strong>.</p>
               <p>Not on any face.</p>
               <p><strong>PERMEATING ALL</strong>: in dossier’s squirming glyphs, in wall’s flowing shadows, in chain’s cold gleam, in villagers’ standardized grin-curves…</p>
               <p><strong>NYARLATHOTEP’S NON-EUCLIDEAN SMILE</strong>—the Crawling Chaos savoring this grand rhapsody.</p>
               <p>This so-called “magnificent achievement”, this ritual of compressing/warping/converting incommensurable trauma into quantifiable metrics and “bliss” performances…</p>
               <p><strong>A COLOSSAL SACRIFICE OF HUMAN SPIRIT TO THE UNNAMEABLE!</strong></p>
               <p><em>“HUMANITY! LIVE HAPPILY!”</em>—that noble goal, merely the <strong>PRIEST’S FINAL MOCK-BLESSING TO THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB</strong>.</p>
               <h4><a name="[FINALE: INTRA/EXTRA VESSEL]"></a><span></span>[FINALE: INTRA/EXTRA VESSEL]</h4>
               <p>His final human sight: Old Nian outside the window, <strong>“GLORY CERTIFICATE”</strong> clenched in fist.</p>
               <p>Moonlight revealed eyes—no longer vacant—<strong>ABYSSAL HYBRID OF ANCESTRAL RAGE AND NEW MADNESS</strong>.</p>
               <p>Slowly, savagely, he tore the scarlet certificate—the VESSEL’S “bliss” sigil—in half, then quarters… <strong>FRAGMENTS DESCENDING LIKE VOID-SNOW</strong>.</p>
               <p>Wang tried to shout—to warn of the omnipresent <strong>SMILE</strong>, the <strong>COSMOCRATOR’S GAZE</strong>.</p>
               <p>But his mouth birthed not words—only <strong>STACCATO SHRIEKS OF GRINDING LITHOSPHERE AND SNAPPING FEMURS</strong>—</p>
               <p> <strong>THE SOUND OF VESSEL WALLS IMPLODING.<br>THE WAIL OF METABOLIZED TRAUMA.<br>NYARLATHOTEP’S ULTIMATE SUSURRUS IN HIS RUINED MIND.</strong></p>
               <p>Old Nian heard the aberration. Jerked his head up. Bloodshot eyes <strong>PIERCING DARKNESS</strong>, locking onto what remained of Wang—or what <strong>BECAME</strong> within him.</p>
               <p>Old Nian’s jaws unhinged—<strong>A FERAL, COGNIZANT, NON-HUMAN RICTUS OF COMRADESHIP IN CHAOS</strong>.</p>
               <p>Then he turned—<strong>A SHADOW DISSOLVING INTO NIGHT</strong>—vanished up the mountain path.</p>
               <p>Only fluorescent hum remained. The ex-commissar—<strong>PUPILS DILATED INTO VOIDS</strong>, drool mingling with atonal shrieks—slumped in his chair.</p>
               <p>On the wall, shadow-sigils stabilized—<strong>A PERFECT, GLACIAL, SELF-REPLICATING OUROROBOROS CIRCUIT</strong>.</p>
               <p><strong>THE CRAWLING CHAOS’ RHAPSODY CONTINUED, SILENT.</strong><br><strong>A NEW MOVEMENT BREWED IN PAPER-SHREDS AND BONE-SYNTAX.</strong></p>
